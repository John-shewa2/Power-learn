FILE MANIPULATION IN PYTHON INVOLVES OPENING, READING, WRITING, AND CLOSING FILES USING BUILT-IN FUNCTIONS.
THE OPEN() FUNCTION IS USED TO ACCESS A FILE, WITH MODES LIKE 'R' (READ), 'W' (WRITE), 'A' (APPEND), AND 'RB'/'WB' FOR BINARY FILES.
YOU CAN READ FILE CONTENT USING METHODS LIKE .READ(), .READLINE(), OR .READLINES().
TO WRITE TO A FILE, USE .WRITE() OR .WRITELINES() AFTER OPENING IT IN WRITE OR APPEND MODE.
ALWAYS CLOSE A FILE USING .CLOSE(), OR USE A WITH OPEN(...) AS F: BLOCK FOR AUTOMATIC HANDLING.

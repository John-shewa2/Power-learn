        <p>
          This is a beginner's guide to understanding the basics of web
          development. It covers the essential technologies and concepts that
          form the foundation of building websites and web applications.

          Web development involves creating websites and applications for the
          internet. It encompasses various disciplines, including front-end and
          back-end development. Front-end development focuses on the user
          interface and user experience, while back-end development deals with
          server-side logic and database management. In this guide, we will
          explore three core technologies:

        <h2>1. HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</h2>
        <img src="image1.jpg" alt="HTML5 Logo" width="300" height="200" />
        <p>
          HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard language
          used to create and design web pages. HTML is not a programming
          language; instead, it is a markup language that structures content on
          the internet. With HTML, developers can define elements such as
          headings, paragraphs, images, links, and lists using tags enclosed in
          angle brackets (e.g., &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, &lt;a&gt;, &lt;img&gt;).
          These tags tell the web browser how to display the content. HTML
          documents start with a &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; declaration followed by
          the &lt;html&gt; tag, which wraps all the content of the page. Inside
          the &lt;html&gt; tag, there are usually two main sections:
          &lt;head&gt; and &lt;body&gt;. The &lt;head&gt; contains metadata
          about the page, like the title, character encoding, and links to
          stylesheets, while the &lt;body&gt; contains the actual content that
          appears on the page. With the release of HTML5, many new features and
          semantic tags were introduced. Tags like &lt;header&gt;,
          &lt;footer&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, and &lt;section&gt; help
          structure content more meaningfully, making it easier for both
          developers and search engines to understand the page. HTML is often
          used alongside CSS (for styling) and JavaScript (for interactivity),
          forming the core of modern web development. Learning HTML is the first
          step to becoming a web developer, as it builds the foundation for
          everything that appears on the web.

        <h2>2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</h2>
        <img src="image2.png" alt="CSS3 Logo" width="300" height="200" />
        <p>
          CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a language used to
          describe the appearance and formatting of a document written in HTML.
          While HTML structures the content of a webpage, CSS controls how that
          content looks — including its colors, fonts, sizes, spacing,
          alignment, and layout. CSS allows web developers to create visually
          appealing websites by separating design from structure. For example,
          using CSS, you can make a heading red, center a paragraph, or add
          background colors to different sections. CSS styles can be written
          inline (inside an HTML tag), in the &lt;style&gt; block within the
          HTML file, or in an external stylesheet linked to the page. This
          separation makes web design more flexible and easier to maintain,
          especially when styling large websites. With the help of CSS, modern
          web pages become more responsive and visually attractive across
          different devices and screen sizes.

      <section id="javascript">
        <h2>3. JavaScript</h2>
        <img src="image3.png" alt="JavaScript Logo" width="300" height="200" />
        <p>
          JavaScript is a powerful programming language used to add
          interactivity and dynamic behavior to websites. While HTML structures
          the content and CSS styles the appearance, JavaScript allows users to
          interact with the page — such as clicking buttons, filling out forms,
          displaying alerts, or updating content without reloading the page. It
          runs directly in the web browser, making it possible to create
          engaging features like image sliders, live form validation, and
          real-time updates. JavaScript is a key part of modern web development
          and is often used together with HTML and CSS to create fully
          functional web applications. Developers can write JavaScript directly
          in the HTML file using the &lt;script&gt; tag or in a separate file
          linked to the page. Over time, JavaScript has become more powerful
          with tools and frameworks like React, Vue, and Node.js, allowing
          developers to build everything from small websites to complex web
          apps.
